## Design

### Color Scheme
The color scheme for this website was greatly inspired by an existing store's logo. It is made up of a triadic color scheme that not only creates a classy and dynamic effect but also a good contrast throughout. By uploading the logo on the Coolors palette generator, the following color combinations were created in hex value:

### Typography

Three fonts imported from Google fonts were largely used throughout this website, namely 'Barriecito' for the hero image text overlay, 'Charm'(Bold 700) for the headings and 'Inter'(Regular 400) for the rest parts. Fallback fonts such as Sans-serif, Cursive and System-sui were also added as suggested by Google fonts on the 'How to use' section.

![Fonts used in the project](assets/img/fonts-used.JPG)

## Imagery
Pinterest was mainly used to search, save and organize the images in a board to be used for the project, with exception to some images bearing the 'Bobo tea' logo which were downloaded from the Instagram page of the Bobo tea shop with the permission of the owner. The quality of the images were tested on (https://fineartprinting.com.sg/image-analyser/#).


## Wireframes
The first and foremost wireframes for this website were made on paper and thereafter modified slightly when it was created digitally using Balsamiq.com. The website consists of five pages in total - the Home page, Menu page, Gallery page, Sign Up page and a Thank You page where subscribers are redirected to upon signing-up.

## Features

- ### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar for this website is featured on each page, with the business logo positioned on the left side and all the other navigational links situated to the right side. This style is set for devices with max screen size 950px and 1200px and this is how it looks:

![Navigation bar for website](assets/img/Navbar.png)

For small screen sizes such as screen size max 768px and max 594px and down, the navigation bar collapses into a hamburger menu on the right corner while the logo hangs still on the left side. Upon clicking on the hamburger menu, it will drop down to feature the rest pages which are highlighted into a box shadow upon hovering.

The footer sits at the bottom of each page, adding spotlight to the operating days and hours of business, the contact information of the business such as email, address and phone number, and the social media links like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Yelp to connect to the business.

- ## Home page
The home page features the hero image which showcases a variety of captivating and mouthwatering in-house prepared bubble teas, with a text overlayed on it that triggers the desire for the drinks. Below it, an image and some information about the store are included, together with a ‘View Menu’ button in case the visitor can’t wait to see the menu in the next page. Another section below, features the weekly promotional items for registered members only, including a sign up offer link that will direct those interested to the Sign-Up page. And last but not least, Boba section gives a visitor who’s new to bubble tea an idea of what kind of drink it is, where does it originates from and how good it is.

The menu page is actually the icing on the cherry! First of all. Provides a step to step guide about how to order bubble tea so that time is saved and service will be faster at the counter. The order section provides a wide range of vibrant bubble teas highlighting so many flavours and their prices.

The gallery page showcases how bubble tea is embraced by all cultures, all generations and how it has become the hip beverage of all parties and get-togethers nowadays. Visitors can relate to it and can be inspired to order some for their parties and get-togethers. These page has been designed in a responsive manner with three columns of imagery in laptops and two on smaller size tablets and one column for mobile devices.

Eventually, when clicking on the sign up button in the registration form, the user will land on the thank you page where they will also find their 15% discount code for their first purchase in store.

## Future Implementations

At some point in the future, I would like to add an order button in the navbar and 
link it to a page which will be designed accordingly for online delivery orders or click and collect orders which will be beneficial to the business and will also meet the users' purpose.

## Accessibility

Generally, aria labels have been placed in all the pages as well as alt text on images to make it more accessible for users with low vision, users with mobility disabilities and users with memory loss.

### PSI Testing
Google PageSpeed Insights (PSI), a free tool was utilized for gauging the performance and accessibility measures of the website. Initially, the performance and speed was not so highly rated generally because of the large images and lack of aria labels. I tried to compress and convert many of the images from jpeg format to png, and I added missing aria labels to elements for better accessibility which significantly improved the performance of my website. Below are the final PSI results:

## Known Bugs

When scrolling on mobile devices, the menu page was displaying white space on the right side and I took tutor support to resolve that. It has now been removed.

There was an issue with the responsiveness of the Menu page as well. The images would not wrap when adjusting them in media queries for screen max-size 594px. With tutor's assistance, that was fixed as well. 

At the initial stage of the project there were issues with Codeanywhere not loading up for hours and that was so frustrating because it was time wasting. I then decided to work on VS Code but at a later stage when I got stuck with few sections in my project, I needed tutor support, and then I was advised to shift to Gitpod cloud IDE. Hence, I copied my progress to Gitpod and worked from there to have a workspace that I knew would load for me every time, and also make use of the tutoring facility. 

However, just few days before I complete my project, there was an unusual change with Gitpod - I could not see the changes I made in the browser in realtime, even though I was clearing the cache. This was again so frustrating because I was very close to the finish. I had to use Gitpod from another laptop to be able to complete my work and I had student care support as well.

I came across semantic errors after validating my HTML and CSS codes, and all of them were fixed.
