# Portfolio Project 2
##  Guess the Country
Guess the Country is a free multi-landmark guessing game where a landmark image is shown and three options or hints are given to the player to guess the exact country name corresponding to the landmark within a 30 seconds alloted time. The main objective of this website is to create a fully functional guessing game that will help increase general knowledge about geography, the world and its amazing places, and help improve deductive reasoning, social skills and memory recognition.

## Design

### Color Scheme
The color scheme for this website was greatly inspired by the background image that was downloaded from unsplash.com website and the logo that was downloaded from ios icon gallery. From background color, the other colors were chosen to create a good contrast and a dynamic effect throughout the website. The rest colors were generated from Coolors palette generator and the following pleasing color combinations were created in hex value:

### Typography

Built-in font family Verdana was used throughout this website, with fallback fonts such as Sans-serif and Tahoma. 

![Fonts used in the project](assets/img/verdana.webp)

## Imagery
The background image was downloaded from <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/assorted-color-hot-air-balloons-during-daytime-DuBNA1QMpPA" target="_blank">unsplash.com</a> and the logo was taken from <a href="https://www.iosicongallery.com/" target="_blank">ios icon gallery</a> while the landmark images were wisely chosen from Pinterest with the exception of SÃ©nanque Abbey (France) imagery which was taken from Shutterstock website. After Lighthouse testing, all images were converted into webp format to improve the website's performance.

## Wireframes
The first and foremost wireframes for this website were made using paper and pencil. Thereafter they were digitally designed using Balsamiq.com with some light modifications. Guess the Country is a one page website consisting of six modals used to keep vistors engaged.

## Features

### Game Screen Components

**1.** <u>**Logo and Buttons**</u>

Guess the Country is a one page website designed simply, with some amount of interactivity and a touch of elegance. The desktop game screen features the 'guessing cat' logo in the top-center and two buttons on its either side - a start button and a 'How to Play' button. While the mobile game screen features the logo on the very top and the same two buttons below it, styled differently.

**2.** <u>**Title**</u>

The title has been styled into a gorgeous text animation effect. Credit goes to <a href="https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/css-text-animations/" target="_blank">alvarotrigo.com</a>

![Title](assets/img/Hamburger.jpg)

**3.** <u>**Sound/Timer/Score Components**</u>

A mute and unmute icon from frontawesome website can be found on left below the title. Special sound effects from Pixabay have been added in addition to the color transform effect on option buttons when clicked. An enthusiastic sound can be heard when the right answer is clicked and if the sound is on unmute mode, else if wrong answer is clicked, a disappointing tune can be heard. The sound can be muted or unmuted as per the visitor's preference.

The Score is positioned on the right side below the title and it will keep updating when the game is on. 

The timer is placed in the middle of the mute/unmute button and the score so that all three major components are visible on the user's screen when playing the game. 

**4.** <u>**Landmark Images**</u>
Landmark images situated below the sound/timer/score components will appear back-to-back when the game will be on.

**5.** <u>**Option Buttons**</u>
Three option buttons are featured below each landmark image.

**4.** <u>**Star Rating and form**</u>

- ### Footer
The footer sits at the bottom of each page, adding spotlight to the operating days and hours of business, the contact information of the business such as email, address and phone number, and the social media links like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Yelp to connect to the business.

- ## 404 page

Eventually, when clicking on the sign up button in the registration form, the user will land on the thank you page where they will also find their 15% discount code for their first purchase in store.

![Thank you page](assets/img/Thankyou-page.png)

## Future Implementations

At some point in the future, I would like to add a welcome page that will feature two more topics aside landmarks like 'People' and 'Food' so when the user will click in one of these category, the game screen will open up displaying related images and options with all the rest components. I will also add a score track and a star rating track to render the game more interesting.

## Accessibility

Generally, aria labels have been placed in all the pages as well as alt text on images to make it more accessible for users with low vision, users with mobility disabilities and users with memory loss.

**W3C Validator was used to validate the HTML 5 code written on all pages for my website**

### PSI Testing
Google PageSpeed Insights (PSI), a free tool was utilized for gauging the performance and accessibility measures of the website. Initially, the performance and speed was not so highly rated generally because of the large images and lack of aria labels. I tried to compress and convert many of the images from jpeg format to png, and I added missing aria labels to elements for better accessibility which significantly improved the performance of my website. Below are the final PSI results:

## Known Bugs

When scrolling on mobile devices, the menu page was displaying white space on the right side and I took tutor support to resolve that. It has now been removed.

There was an issue with the responsiveness of the Menu page as well. The images would not wrap when adjusting them in media queries for screen max-size 594px. With tutor's assistance, that was fixed as well. 

At the initial stage of the project there were issues with Codeanywhere not loading up for hours and that was so frustrating because it was time wasting. I then decided to work on VS Code but at a later stage when I got stuck with few sections in my project, I needed tutor support, and then I was advised to shift to Gitpod cloud IDE. Hence, I copied my progress to Gitpod and worked from there to have a workspace that I knew would load for me every time, and also make use of the tutoring facility. 

However, just few days before I complete my project, there was an unusual change with Gitpod - I could not see the changes I made in the browser in realtime, even though I was clearing the cache. This was again so frustrating because I was very close to the finish. I had to use Gitpod from another laptop to be able to complete my work and I had student care support as well.

I came across semantic errors after validating my HTML and CSS codes, and all of them were fixed.
